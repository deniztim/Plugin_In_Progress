You have successfully created an Atlassian Plugin!

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

Full documentation is always available at:

This is a plugin that adds an item on Jira Add-ons list and lets you add or remove 
configurations from it, which has two user picker fields that interacts with the 
database and saves the value inside them after a button click.
